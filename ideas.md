<idea>
  **Design Movement**: "Analog Warmth / Mid-Century Modern"
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Tactile & Organic**: The interface should feel like a physical workbook or a vintage amplifier.
  2. **Warm & Inviting**: Use colors that evoke wood, tubes, and paper, avoiding cold digital blues.
  3. **Structured but Relaxed**: Layouts that guide the eye comfortably, like a well-designed magazine.
  4. **Focus on Clarity**: Theory can be dry; the design should make it feel approachable and human.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Palette**: Cream/Off-white background (paper), Deep Espresso (text), Amber/Gold (accents/highlights), Muted Sage (secondary), Burnt Orange (interactive elements).
  - **Intent**: To create a cozy, "living room" learning environment. It feels like sitting down with a good teacher and a cup of coffee.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Asymmetric & Editorial**: Use a sidebar for navigation that mimics a book spine or binder tab. Content area is wide and readable.
  - **Card-Based Lessons**: Lessons are presented as "cards" or "pages" that sit on the background.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Texture**: Subtle paper grain or noise on the background.
  - **Typography**: A strong serif for headings (e.g., "Playfair Display" or "Merriweather") paired with a clean, geometric sans-serif for body text (e.g., "DM Sans" or "Inter" - wait, avoid Inter, let's use "Outfit").
  - **Visual Metaphors**: Fretboard diagrams that look hand-drawn or stamped.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Soft & Deliberate**: Hover effects are gentle fades or slight lifts, not snappy jumps.
  - **"Turning the Page"**: Transitions between lessons feel like moving through a book.

  **Animation**:
  - **Fade & Slide**: Content enters with a soft slide-up and fade-in.
  - **Highlighting**: Interactive elements glow warmly when active.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: Serif (warm, authoritative but friendly).
  - **Body**: Sans-serif (modern, legible).
  - **Code/Tab**: Monospace (classic, typewriter-style).

  **Design Movement**: "Neo-Brutalism / High-Contrast Utility"
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Raw & Direct**: No fluff. Theory is a tool; the site is the workbench.
  2. **High Contrast**: Black and white with bold splashes of neon color for emphasis.
  3. **Grid-Exposed**: Show the structure. Lines, borders, and boxes are visible and thick.
  4. **Bold Typography**: Big, loud headings that demand attention.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Palette**: Stark White or Light Grey background, Pitch Black text/borders, Neon Green or Electric Blue for active states/highlights.
  - **Intent**: To feel like a technical manual or a piece of precision equipment. It says "This is serious, effective learning."

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Modular Grid**: Everything lives in clearly defined boxes with thick borders.
  - **Split Screen**: Text on one side, code/visuals on the other, separated by a hard line.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Hard Shadows**: Buttons and cards have solid, non-blurred drop shadows (retro UI style).
  - **Monospace Headings**: Use a coding font for titles to emphasize the "theory as code" aspect.
  - **Visible Geometry**: Shapes are geometric and sharp-edged.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Snappy & Tactile**: Buttons depress visibly. Hover states are instant color swaps.
  - **Mechanical**: Interactions feel like flipping switches or pressing keys.

  **Animation**:
  - **Instant & Linear**: No easing. Things appear or slide in with mechanical precision.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: Bold Sans or Monospace (e.g., "Space Grotesk" or "JetBrains Mono").
  - **Body**: Clean Sans (e.g., "Public Sans").
  - **Code/Tab**: Monospace (essential).

  **Design Movement**: "Ethereal / Soundwave Gradient"
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Fluid & Musical**: Music is vibration. The design should feel like sound waves—fluid, gradient-heavy, and smooth.
  2. **Dark Mode Default**: Musicians often work in dim studios. A dark, immersive interface reduces eye strain.
  3. **Glassmorphism**: Layers of semi-transparent "glass" to create depth and hierarchy.
  4. **Focus on Flow**: The user should feel like they are flowing through the content.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Palette**: Deep Midnight Blue/Black background. Gradients of Purple, Teal, and Magenta for accents (vaporwave/synthwave influence but more refined).
  - **Intent**: To inspire creativity and focus. It feels like a modern DAW (Digital Audio Workstation).

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Floating Elements**: Content containers float over the abstract, moving background.
  - **Centered Focus**: The active lesson is the clear center of attention, with other elements fading back.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Gradients**: Soft, moving gradients in the background.
  - **Blur Effects**: Backdrop filters on panels (glass effect).
  - **Rounded Corners**: Everything is soft and rounded.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Fluid & Elastic**: Elements bounce slightly or morph.
  - **Glow**: Active elements emit a soft light.

  **Animation**:
  - **Continuous Motion**: Subtle background movement (slow-moving gradients).
  - **Smooth Transitions**: Pages dissolve into each other.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: Modern Geometric Sans (e.g., "Outfit" or "Plus Jakarta Sans").
  - **Body**: Highly legible Sans (e.g., "Satoshi").
  - **Code/Tab**: Monospace with syntax highlighting colors that match the theme.
